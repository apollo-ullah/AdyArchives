# Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the fundamental algorithms in machine learning. It serves as a building block for understanding more complex models.

## Mathematical Formulation

In linear regression, we model the relationship between input features $x$ and target variable $y$ as:

$$
y = wx + b
$$

where $w$ is the weight (slope) and $b$ is the bias (intercept).

## Implementation

Here's a simple implementation using Python and NumPy:

<CodeBlock language="python">
import numpy as np

def linear*regression(X, y): # Add bias term
X_b = np.c*[np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X]

    # Compute weights using normal equation
    theta = np.linalg.inv(X_b.T @ X_b) @ X_b.T @ y

    return theta[1:], theta[0]

</CodeBlock>

## Loss Function

The mean squared error (MSE) loss function is defined as:

$$
L(w,b) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (wx_i + b))^2
$$
